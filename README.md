# Deadlock-Algorithms-For-Detection-And-Resolve-Deadlock

In distributed database system data is stored on multiple sites and execution of transaction can initiate from any site. Transaction is sequence of read, write, lock and unlock operations which are executed as a single unit. In DDS transactions are executed concurrently i.e. concurrent updates are performed on data items. Deadlock in DDS results because of concurrency control mechanism which prevents multiple transactions from coming in one anotherâ€™s way while executing simultaneously. Deadlock leaves transactions in never ending waiting condition i.e. due to infinite waiting state transactions are killed automatically which decreases efficiency of DDS drastically so it is very important to prevent, detect and resolve deadlock as soon as possible
